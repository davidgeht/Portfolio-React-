<h3>Full Stack Web <u>Developer</u></h3>
<br></br>
<p>My name is David Gehtman, I am a young professional living at the heart of toronto's mid town at yonge and eglinton.
Orignally I studied kinesiology at york university, and decided to switch my interest to full stack development.
In my spare time I enjoy being active, by playing basketball and heading to the gym.
I also enjoy hiking, camping and trekking. I also enjoy walking my dog named ceaser, he is a half labrador and half husky.
